# ðŸŽ¯ Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
# I was able to fork and push the repo to vercel and fixed errors locally.
# I added an error.js which occurs when the user tries to upvote whilst not being logged in.
# I added a constraint to my sql query string so it only allows the user to upvote or downvote on a comment once.
# I added a page title to my posts so it matches the post page.
# ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?
# I was not able to incoropate tiptap and the other strech goals in the readme.
# ðŸŽ¯ If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
# I would say I found this task fine just needed more time to check out tiptap and the other tasks.
